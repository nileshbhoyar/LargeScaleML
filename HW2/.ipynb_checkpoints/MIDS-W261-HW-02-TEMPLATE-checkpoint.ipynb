    "### General information on the enronemail.txt data file\n",
    "These data include email messages from 6 enron employees(in addition to various spam messages from a variety of sources) that were made publicly available after the company's collapse. These data were originally part of a much larger set that included many more individuals, but were distilled to the 6 for a publication developing\n",
    "personalized Bayesian spam filters. Please follow the links below for precise information regarding this data and research.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "For their work, Metsis et al. (the authors) appeared to have pre-processed the data,\n",
    "not only collapsing all text to lower-case, but additionally separating \"words\" by spaces,\n",
    "where \"words\" unfortunately include punctuation. As a concrete example, the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Hey Jon, I hope you don't get lost out there this weekend!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "would have been reduced by Metsis et al. to the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"hey jon , i hope you don ' t get lost out there this weekend ! \"\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon seeing this we have reverted the data back toward its original state, removing spaces so that our sample sentence would now look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"hey jon, i hope you don't get lost out there this weekend!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "so that we have at least preserved contractions and other higher-order lexical forms. However, one must be aware that this reversion is not complete, and that some object (specifically web sites) will be ill-formatted, and that all text is still lower-cased.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Format of the Enron SPAM data\n",
    "All messages are collated to a tab-delimited format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ID \\t SPAM \\t SUBJECT \\t CONTENT \\n\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ID = string; unique message identifier\n",
    "    SPAM = binary; with 1 indicating a spam message\n",
    "    SUBJECT = string; title of the message\n",
    "    CONTENT = string; content of the message\n",
    "\n",

    "0006.2001-02-08.kitchen\t0\t california power 2/8\t\" please contact kristin walsh (x 39510) or robert johnston (x 39934) for further clarification.  executive summary:  utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles-agreement on payback for the bailout, rate increases, and further short-term funding for dwr purchases of power.  disagreement persists between gov. davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities. the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets.  the economics of the long-term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period.  air quality management district regulations are under review, but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity.  legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left-wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow, if not stop, davis's bailout and rate hike plans. senator burton's eminent domain threats against generators, which reflect this pressure, are of little significance.  1. bankruptcy outlook rising once again  a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state, the utilities, and their creditors, with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday.  socal edison and pg & e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll. they are working very hard to keep cash on-hand, and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing. once this filing occurs, they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy.  opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy. assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely, but that everything will be resolved during that 50-day period. senator john burton \"\" is in no hurry \"\" to reach a deal with the utilities, as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to \"\" strong-arm \"\" the utilities. burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy. the senator stated, \"\" bankruptcy would be bad, but not the worst thing possible. \"\" he intends to stick to his position. senator burton also dismissed governor davis'end-of-week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities.  still, bankruptcy can be avoided if a last-minute deal can be struck monday on:  what the state receives in return for the bailout  the scope of rate hikes (a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e/socal v. cpuc rate undercollection case monday)  additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may.  there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance. however, the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve. the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high-level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend.  additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature. the non-energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk, as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund.  2. state to take 2/3 of utility debt  while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the$ 12 billion debt, a final deal has been held up on two fronts. first, it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt. it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and/or transmission assets. a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets. the value of these assets still has not been settled. second, while the state will be on the hook for$ 9 billion, it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout. finally, expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes (although the edison/pg & e v. cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout. the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants.  no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities'transmission assets, which are currently valued at approximately$ 7-$ 8 billion. all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities'debts, as some of the money would go to existing bondholders. however, ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer.  3. long-term contracts  as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday, only 500 mw of the 5,000 mw of power contracted for can come on-line immediately. much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long-term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants. some of this will come on-line in approximately two years.  assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a \"\" tablet from on high \"\" from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase. this means that the state must acquire power, not from internal sources or from the market, but through long-term contracts at 7. 39 cents/kwh. this allows 1. 213 cents to amortize socal edison's undercollection from the recent rate freeze period. (the number is slightly different for pg & e.) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of$ 7. 90 in 2001 and$ 5. 15 in 2005, and an efficiency heating rate of 10,000-12,000 in 2001 and 7,200 in 2005.  these numbers were quoted to industry sources, who felt they were unrealistic. these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as$ 9. 00-$ 9. 50. the sources agreed with keeley's number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate, but they felt that 7,200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line.  according to keeley's numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at$ 7 billion rather than$ 12 billion, it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection. a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection. however, since assemblyman keeley's numbers are unrealistic, a rate increase will be necessary.  4. air quality district exemptions  there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd (air quality management district) regulations--ab 20 x, ab 28 x, ab 31 x. also, republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government.  currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions. the legislature will not allow \"\" dirtier \"\" plants to  come on-line. however, there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the  use of credits (this apparently drives up the cost of gas-fired power).  5. democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates  the moderate left (sen. burton, the puc, consumer activists) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement. this is not just because of his initiative. more important from their perspective, his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election. thus, democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout.  6. eminent domain would have a limited effect  the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited. they only apply to california suppliers. a  federal order would be needed to seize assets from out-of-state suppliers. there are also canadian suppliers (such as bc hydro) who are essentially untouchable.  7. smaller ipps feeling the squeeze  many of the smaller ipps, which account for approximately 2500 mw of production, appear to be within a few days of running out of cash.  ab lx may be amended, possibly sometime this week, to give the smaller producers credit support.\"\n",

    "0008.2004-08-01.BG\t1\t\" slotting order confirmation may 18,2004 etacitne\"\t\" {% begin_split 76%}  the rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the train. i am afraid to say how many baggage-waggons followed the engine, certainly a score; then came the chinese, then we, then the families, and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what, if i have it rightly, is called his caboose. the class to which i belonged was of course far the largest, and we ran over, so to speak, to both sides; so that there were some caucasians among the chinamen, and some bachelors among the families. but our own car was pure from admixture, save for one little boy of eight or nine who had the whooping-cough. at last, about six, the long train crawled out of the transfer station and across the wide missouri river to omaha, westward bound. it was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars. there was thunder in the air, which helped to keep us restless. a man played many airs upon the cornet, and none of them were much attended to, until he came to \"\" home, sweet home. \"\" it was truly strange to note how the talk ceased at that, and the faces began to lengthen. i have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good or bad; but it belongs to that class of art which may be best described as a brutal assault upon the feelings. pathos must be relieved by dignity of treatment. if you wallow naked in the pathetic, like the author of \"\" home, sweet home, \"\" you make your hearers weep in an unmanly fashion; and even while yet they are moved, they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their weakness. it did not come to tears that night, for the experiment was interrupted. an elderly, hard-looking man, with a goatee beard and about as much appearance of sentiment an you would expect from a retired slaver, turned with a start and bade the performer stop that \"\" damned thing. \"\" \"\" i've heard about enough of that, \"\" he added; \"\" give us something about the good country we're going to. \"\" a murmur of adhesion ran round the car; the performer took the instrument from his lips, laughed and nodded, and then struck into a dancing measure; and, like a new timotheus, stilled immediately the emotion he had raised.  aka: vicqodin,  xacnax,  suprervisagra and much morne-  no presccription neyeded!  civilizirano gullweig gxol sylg  the day faded; the lamps were lit; a party of ht ht men, who got off next evening at north platte, stood together on the stern platform, singing \"\" the sweet by-and-bye \"\" with very tuneful voices; the chums began to put up their beds; and it seemed as if the business of the day were at an end. but it was not so; for, the train stopping at some station, the cars were instantly thronged with the natives, wives and fathers, ht men and maidens, some of them in little more than nightgear, some with stable lanterns, and all offering beds for sale. their charge began with twenty-five cents a cushion, but fell, before the train went on again, to fifteen, with the bed-board gratis, or less than one-fifth of what i had paid for mine at the transfer. this is my contribution to the economy of future emigrants.  a great personage on an american train is the newsboy. he sells books (such books!), papers, fruit, lollipops, and cigars; and on emigrant journeys, soap, towels, tin washing dishes, tin coffee pitchers, coffee, tea, sugar, and tinned eatables, mostly hash or beans and bacon. early next morning the newsboy went around the cars, and chumming on a more extended principle became the order of the hour. it requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds; but washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a syndicate of three. i myself entered a little after sunrise into articles of agreement, and became one of the firm of pennsylvania, shakespeare, and dubuque. shakespeare was my own nickname on the cars; pennsylvania that of my bedfellow; and dubuque, the name of a place in the state of iowa, that of an amiable ht fellow going west to cure an asthma, and retarding his recovery by incessantly chewing or smoking, and sometimes chewing and smoking together. i have never seen tobacco so sillily abused. shakespeare bought a tin washing-dish, dubuque a towel, and pennsylvania a brick of soap. the partners used these instruments, one after another, according to the order of their first awaking; and when the firm had finished there was no want of borrowers. each filled the tin dish at the water filter opposite the stove, and retired with the whole stock in trade to the platform of the car. there he knelt down, supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one elbow crooked about the railing, and made a shift to wash his face and neck and hands; a cold, an insufficient, and, if the train is moving rapidly, a somewhat dangerous toilet.\"\n",

i've done this again and, in fact, had already introduced my ideas to each of them and the previous system prior to forwarding them to houston.  prior to having to leave enron, i wanted to make a best effort to get the authority to execute the recommendations i've pretty consistently introduced since joining in late 1998 and tried to get enron to implement under the previous management. i have not had the opportunity to manage or influence the company's operations in south america-this is my fault for not negotiating a more senior position, but i made the attempt in the region and more recently with the new managers to demonstrate a need to open constructive, critical discussion.  anyway, i've tried to open the door to john, dave and you and others who are interested to brainstorm inlcuding the leadership in place in esa to understand and perhaps leverage my applied experience-both trading, origination and, importantly, cultural. my resume below should attest to my capabilities-at least in terms of the potential value of my observations.  thank you for your efforts extended in my behalf and good luck in your new position and working within enron's unique, dynamic ethic.  d'arcy  louise kitchen @ ect  02/09/2001 01:46 pm  to: d'arcy carroll/sa/enron @ enron  cc:  subject: re: brazil commercial-* * update version, delete previous * *  i have spoken to john lavorato on this and he says that dave and john have already spoken to you on this. do we still need to meet as i have no different opinion to them at this time.  louise  d'arcy carroll @ enron  02/09/2001 11:13 am  to: louise kitchen @ ect  cc:  subject: brazil commercial-* * update version, delete previous * *  louise,  this is a lot of text including the attatched files, but is the summary gist of what i have tried to communicate internally and am asking to discuss with you this morning.  ----------------------forwarded by d'arcy carroll/sa/enron on 02/09/2001 02:14 pm---------------------------  d'arcy carroll  11/09/2000 06:20 pm  to: david w delainey @ ect, john j lavorato/corp/enron @ enron  cc: kay chapman @ ect  subject: brazil commercial-* * update version, delete previous * *  david/john-understand the trip will be delayed.  proposal outline has two texts-i. commercial strategy and ii. historical perspective. the org charts will need some discussion-particularly in regard to the strengths and weakness of employed personnel and urgent need for an improved structure.  over the fh 2000 and within the new structure with brett and joao carlos albuquerque in place, the wholesale group and trading desk seems to have made some important strides forward in terms of recruiting some good individuals and, in trading terms, finally executing some fundamental market supply, demand and transmission analysis.  to get into the game quickly and aggressively, though, i think the commercial group needs to hire some senior, local trading expertise. i apoligize, but was unable to get in contact with either of these two guys to set up a possible meeting this week. however, they have the local knowledge, trading competencies and management experience which i consider needed to catalyze the regional effort:  axel hinsch-argentine and cargill employee with several years and broad commodity and financial trading, business development and management experience, including senior trader for the bear stearns emerging markets equity desks in the late 1980 s/early 1990 s. straight up, no ego  argentine country manager.  mark hoffman-swiss/brazilian and glencore employee with several years energy, energy distribution and sugar sector experience; applied commodity and financial arbitrage experience in the brazilian market. lot less straight forward, but applied knowledge and expertise.  senior originator/trader.  please forward any input about your interest in scheduling a meeting either open here or in houston during the week of nov 20.  for some perspective on my experience at enron, let me explaing that i have been working in enron networks in the region from q 2'00 and therefore much less formally invovled with the trading (brazil spot market) and wholesale pricing, tarrif issues etc.,.. than at the end of fyl 999 when i was directly involved in developing our effort to get in the game in understanding the spot price formula calculations and exploring arbitrage opportunities in the wholesale market.  i've attached my resume for some perspective on my background and capability to critically review the commercial (trading and marketing) and managerial issues involving the past and future opportunities. \"\n",

    "0011.1999-12-14.farmer\t0\t king ranch\t\" there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify  system.  1. cage ranch-since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this  gas on king ranch, it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and  king ranch is re-delivering to stratton. it is also my understanding that  there is a. 05 cent fee  to deliver this gas. we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl  at meter 415 and 9643. this gas  will not be reflected on trans. usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is  not being nominated from a processing agreement. we either, need to input  a point nom (on hpl or krgp) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610,  or a deal for purchase and sale (if king ranch is taking title to the gas)  needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate. i  have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow, so we can  divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made.  2. forest oil-there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow  from the meter (6396) into king ranch. it is my  understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had  their own processing agreement. i need confirmation that the gas from this  meter should be nominated on contract # (96006681) and that this agreement  should have been reassigned to hplc. (it is currently still under hplr).  if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement, then once  again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a  point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643.\"\n",

 ~ ~ ~ ~  this is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the  message. i did not like the background colour, however that is  personal, it did not detract from the information. i was tempted  to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see  a current issue. there was an error in the wording (a word  missed) which needs correction and i think the fonts could be  smaller. overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. * cheers *  ~ ~ ~ ~  could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also  are errors in the following paragraphs:  \"\" first com-first serve \"\" and \"\" to place a sponsor advertisement,  send your to my email \"\"  ~ ~ ~ ~  a single page site. it is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's  newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be  a way to get people to visit. i wouldn't, for example. he claims to  have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably  didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be  better served if he at least put some of the things out there for  all to see-when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to  subscribe. as it is, i would not bother.  ~ ~ ~ ~  what does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? some useful  resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy  advertisement on the net. but what we get here is a newsletter  with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr @ yahoo. com)  asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad.  he also tells of paid category of advertisements. this is all we get  from a site which has a grand title. even the information about  the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40  points size which gets difficult to read.  ~ ~ ~ ~  a neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on  the eyes. there is only really one problem with this page-its  just an advertisement for a newsletter. no, scratch that, its an  advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. a bold enough  move perhaps but i learned hardly anything about the newsletter  itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of  ads to my email account so i didn't even subscribe. presumably  you'd want to get people to sign up so might i suggest splitting  the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue,  a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click  for more info on your free ads.  ________________________________________  vote on your favorite website design!

 if not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into  your sales letter...  1) write your sales letter with an individual in mind.  go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your  sales letter to. doesn't matter if it is grandma or your  next door neighbor or your cat. write your sales letter  just like you are writing it to them personally. why?  because when your potential customer reads, it then it will  seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.  too often, sales letters are written as if they were going  to be read to an audience rather than one person. keep your  sales letters personal, because one person at a time is  going to read them.  2) use an illustration to get your point across. in my  sales letters i have told stories about my car stalling on  the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must  constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our  businesses running. i have compared the hype of easily  making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback  across montana on a grizzly bear. leads have read of how  getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively  marketing online. people love a good story that pounds home  a solid message. tell stories that illustrate a point you  are trying to make. emphasize a benefit by sharing an  account from the \"\" real world. \"\" it effectively creates  interest and further establishes the point.  3) create an interest in the reader from the very first  line. your first line of the sales letter should  immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know  more. go back to the beginning of this article. the first  words were, \"\" it's true. \"\" i can guarantee you that either  consciously or subconsciously you thought \"\" what's true? \"\"  immediately, your mind wanted to know what i was talking  about. before you even knew it you were right here, 8  paragraphs into this article. carefully craft your first  line. if you can immediately get them wanting to know more,  you've got a winner.  4) use bullets. people spend a lot of time reading bulleted  lists. in fact, they often reread them over and over. use  bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or  service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.  use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight  each line and create a sense of more length to the list.  5) launch into a bullet list immediately. shortly after  your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet  list of benefits to absorb. hit them with your best shot.  pull out the big guns and stress \"\" just a few of \"\" the most  important things the reader will discover. by offering a  killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically  create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad  copy. after all, if they are already interested after the  first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to  finding out even more reasons why your product or service  will aid them.  6) just let it all flow out. write down everything that  enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. you  can edit it later. if you just sit and start writing  everything you know about your product or service and how it  will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much  information floods your mind. write it all down. then read  through it-you'll be able to add a lot more detail to  many of the points. edit it after you have exhausted all  of your ideas.  7) make your sales letter personal. make sure that the  words \"\" you \"\" and \"\" your \"\" are at least 4: 1 over \"\" i \"\" and \"\" my. \"\"  your ad copy must be written about your customer not  yourself. i'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,  but it's something like this, \"\" i don't care a thing about  your lawn mower, i just care about my lawn. \"\" leads aren't  interested in you or your products, they are interested in  themselves and their wants and needs. when you are finished  with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test  webpage, run a check at http:// www. keywordcount. com and see  what the ratio between \"\" you \"\" and \"\" your \"\" versus references to  \"\" i, \"\" \"\" me, \"\" \"\" my, \"\" etc. it's a free service. make sure it's  at least 4: 1 in favor of the customer.  8) write like you speak. forget all of those rules that  your grammar teacher taught you. write your sales letters  in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.  don't be afraid to begin sentences with \"\" and \"\" or \"\" because. \"\"  don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.  write like you speak. your sales letter isn't the great  american novel, so don't write it like you are ernest  hemingway.  9) use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.  long copy works... but long paragraphs do not. use short  paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. don't be  afraid to use short sentences. like this one.  or this.  see what i mean? shorter paragraphs keep the interest of  the reader. longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often  force the reader to get distracted.  10) stress the benefits, not the features. again,  readers want the burning question answered, \"\" what's in it  for me? \"\" what need is it going to meet? what want is it  going to fill? how is your product or service going to be  of value or benefit to the reader? spell it out. don't  focus on the features of your product or service, but  rather how those features will add value to the life of your  reader.  for example: if you are selling automobile tires, you may  very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,  but who cares? i don't care about your selection. but, i  do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while  we are traveling. so, instead of focusing on your selection,  you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe  because you have a tire that will fit my car. you're not  selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. stress  the benefits, not the features.  11) keep the reader interested. some sales letters read  like they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can  perform some complicated surgery on my wife. they are  filled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to  understand. unless you are writing to a very targeted  audience, avoid using technical language that many readers  might not understand. keep it simple, using words, language  and information that are easy to understand and follow.  12) target your sales letter. when you are finished with  your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a  specific audience. for example: if you are selling a \"\" work  at home \"\" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding  words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards  women who are homemakers. then, rewrite the same sales  letter and target it to college students. write another  letter targeting senior citizens. still another could be  written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income  during summer vacation. the possibilities are endless.  all you need to do is add a few words here and there in  your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service  is specifically designed for a target audience. \"\" work only  5 hours a week, \"\" would become \"\" college students, work only  5 hours a week. \"\" your sales letter is now targeted. upload  all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website  (you could easily target 100's of groups).  then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted  mediums. you could advertise the \"\" college students \"\" page  in a campus ezine. the \"\" senior citizens \"\" page could be  advertised at a retirement community message board.  by creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally  open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product  to. and, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a  match made for them.  13) make your ad copy easy to follow. use short sentences  and paragraphs. break up the sales letter with attention  grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. one  thing that i have always found to work very well in sales  letters...  ... is to use a pause like this.  start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting  to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. also,  if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on  several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook  line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. \"\" let's  get you started down the road to success, shall we? click  here to continue. \"\"  14) use similes and metaphors for effect. when the  customer purchases your product, they will generate \"\" a flood  of traffic that would make noah start building another ark. \"\"  if they do not order today, then they will \"\" feel like a cat  that let the mouse get away. \"\" use words to create a picture  in the readers'mind. when you think of superman, what  comes to mind? immediately, we remember that he is \"\" faster  than a speeding bullet. \"\" \"\" more powerful than a locomotive. \"\"  \"\" able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. \"\" see how  word pictures stick in our minds?  15) focus on one product or service. don't try to sell  your customer multiple products at the same time. it only  confuses the reader. keep your ad copy directed at one  specific product or service. then, use other products and  services as back-end products.  16) make it stand out. don't kid yourself. there are  hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the  same thing you are doing. how will you stand out among the  crowd? your sales letter must inject personality. it must  breathe of originality. your product or service is  different. it's not like all of the rest. it is unique.  right? your sales letter must separate you from the  competition. it must create a feeling of \"\" you won't find  this anywhere else. \"\"  17) be believable. \"\" earn$ 54,000 in the next 24 hours!!! \"\"  delete. good grief, do they think i am an idiot or  something? get real. don't make outrageous claims that  are obviously not the truth. you'll ruin your reputation.  let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be  reversed. once you have been branded a liar, you will  never be anything but a liar. it doesn't matter if you  launch the most respectable, honest business available  anywhere, people will always have doubt because they  remember the crazy stuff you've said before. be believable.  don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.  18) be specific. don't generalize your information, but  rather be exact. instead of \"\" over 100 tips for losing  weight \"\" use \"\" 124 tips for losing weight. \"\" by generalizing  information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's  mind. \"\" what am i really getting here? does he even know? \"\"  when you use specific information, the reader begins to  think, \"\" this person must have counted. i know exactly what  i can expect. \"\" \"\" platitudes and generalities roll off the  human understanding like water from a duck, \"\" wrote claude  hopkins in his classic book \"\" scientific advertising. \"\" \"\" they  leave no impression whatsoever. \"\"  19) be complete. tell the reader everything they would  want to know about your product or service. answer all of  their questions, anything they would want to consider before  making a purchase. think about it from their point of view.  ask yourself, \"\" why wouldn't i buy this? \"\" then, address that  in your sales letter. remove anything that would keep the  reader from making the purchase.  20) use testimonials to boost your sales. share actual  excerpts from what your current customers are saying about  your product or service. many websites have an entire  section or even a separate page that has endorsements and  compliments listed. satisfied customers remove some of the  doubt in the mind of the reader. \"\" if these people have  found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then i  probably will too. \"\" especially effective are testimonials  from respected, well known \"\" authorities \"\" within your target  field.  21) use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.  a headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your  ad copy. use them frequently-but don't overuse. a well-  placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings  them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next  paragraph. you will want to spend as much time working on  your headlines as you do the entire sales letter. they are  that important.  22) avoid asking stupid questions. \"\" wouldn't you like to  make$ 1,000, 000 a year? \"\" \"\" doesn't that sound great? \"\" \"\" would  you like to be as successful as i am? \"\" avoid any question  that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them  feel like they are inferior.  23) offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.  if the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a  purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try  to influence them to buy in the future. by offering a free  item, you can request their email address in order to  obtain the freebie. by doing this, you can now follow-up  with the customer for a potential future sale.  additionally, you can continue the sales process by having  your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.  and, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful  product or service which impresses the customer, they  probably will be back as a customer soon.  24) use bonuses to overwhelm the reader. one of the things  that i have found very effective in writing sales letters  is to include bonus items that out-value the actual product  i am offering. ginsu made this one famous. they were  selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial  was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table  it was hard to refuse. make sure you provide quality  bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages  the credibility of your main offer.  25) use connective phrases like \"\" but wait, there's more \"\"  and \"\" but that's not all. \"\" these phrases effectively lead  the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly  when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or  leads into bonus items. again, the idea is more and more  value and benefits to the reader.  26) always include a deadline. by including a deadline,  you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.  \"\" if i don't order within 24 hours, then i won't get the  bonuses. \"\" \"\" oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,  i've got to hurry. \"\" let the customer know what they will  be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. remember,  they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will  miss out on all of the benefits of your products. deadlines  are very effective. every sales letter should have one.  27) tell them exactly how to order. be clear as to the  order process. point them towards the order link. tell  them what methods you offer. (i. e. credit cards, checks,  etc.) make this process as simple and clear as can be.  if it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.  28) explain when the product will be delivered. how  quickly will the order be processed?

    "0015.2001-02-12.kitchen\t0\t california update 2/12\t\" executive summary:  the likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60%. this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below, but also because the 30-day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week, increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them. if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly.  1. utilities vs. cpuc  governor davis'attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed. the case will come before the judge on monday, february 12 th. the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities. however, the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ($. 01/kwh). this will be left to an appellate court. the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing, by the smaller ipps (as noted in our reports last week) or by larger out-of-state generators such as duke, reliant, and dynegy (as noted in the press this morning). this is expected next week or the week after.  2. prospects for a bailout  bill ab 18 x is effectively dead from lack of support.  senator burton, despite his public refusals, is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail-out. the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position. they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear. for burton, this is because of his long association with labor unions; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy.  burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him. the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for:  bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state, but with some kind of state support (but less than \"\" full faith and credit of the state of ca, \"\" which would not pass). this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills (e. g.$. 01, though the actual amount is not known). these bonds would be asset-backed securities, with payment receivable from rate payers. the term of these bonds is unknown; if the term is made quite long (e. g. 20 years), the associated rate increase could be very small.  the state would purchase the utilities'transmission assets for a very high price. the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled.  if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), sources believe that this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly. as noted in an earlier report, the california legislature habitually does not act until things \"\" hit the wall. \"\"  it is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton's lead and support the bail-out plan. the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature. one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail-out in her central valley district is \"\" 50 to 1. \"\" however, an involuntary filing (or the threat thereof) may be enough to trigger legislative support. it would allow the argument of an \"\" imminent threat \"\" to the people of the state of california.  3. consumer opposition  harvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum. if the referendum fails, he intends to attack individual legislators (though not john burton, who reportedly has \"\" immunity \"\" from rosenfield).  some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail-out plan, then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later. however, if the bail-out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill (rather than put in place by the puc, for example), it cannot be reversed by a referendum. as additional insurance against rosenfield, by supporting the bonds issued under the plan, the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan. while it is not clear that this is a factual argument, it still might impede any referendum.\"\n",

\"\",  i have to blush & say...  persistence and personality.  of course, i always follow the advice with my own little  disclaimer: what makes me successful may not work the  same for you... & your first lesson is to get over  the deep-seeded idea that success-of any kind, in  my opinion-is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.  clearly, it is not. it's not unknown. it's not unattainable.  it's not years of digging to find the \"\" secrets \"\" to internet riches.  one thing that \"\" gets to me \"\" so often in my work as an  internet consultant, author and internet success  strategist is that so many people on the net seem to  have this incredibly huge mental block that stands  between themselves and success on the net. it's  almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims  of what works and what doesn't work, and so many  long, complicated routes to actually succeeding in  their online venture, that \"\" success \"\" is the equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.  it's not that difficult, my friends! it is not that complicated!!  long-time friend and business associate rick beneteau  has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking  the bank. get it!!  http:// www. roibot. com/bybb. cgi? im 7517_bybtb.  but, the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks  so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your  online venture a success.  and, yes, rick & i come from the same school of  \"\" self marketing \"\"-marketing you! obviously, that's  the core of his excellent new ebook, and i couldn't  agree with him more.  point being, * you * are everything you do online to  succeed. you are your web site, your business, your  marketing piece, your customer service, your customers '  experiences with your business--all of it, is you!  read his ebook & you'll see more of what i'm saying.  the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have  standing high as you can see, blocking the path  between you & internet success. listen to me-it is  not real ok? it doesn't exist. there's nothing there  to fear to begin with... get over it!!  what i'm telling you is, the only thing standing between  you and the success you most desire... is yourself.  when you realize this, you will tear down that brick  wall by means of complete and instantaneous  disintegration. it will no longer exist * in your mind *,  which is the only \"\" real \"\" place it ever was anyhow!  yes, \"\" persistence and personality \"\" inherently includes  honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other  qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate  goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  powerful key to your success... is you!  that may be the most incredible \"\" secret \"\" we ever  uncover in our lifetime! and, trust me, that brick wall  won't ever get in your way again... unless you let it.  talk about simple!!  bryan is a \"\" veteran \"\" internet consultant, author,  internet success strategist & marketer. he publishes  mega-success. com chronicles to over 11,500 subscribing  members, authors articles which appear all over the  net, and helps hundreds of wealth-hungry people in  their journey to internet success.  bryan is also director of his no bs guerrilla internet  marketing group at http://. com  & a fantastic new joint venture partners program  for that site.  bryan hall is a founding member and the development  consultant for the prestigious icop (tm) at  http:// www. i-cop. org/1016. htm  you can reach bryan at 877. 230. 3267 or by  emailing him directly at bryan. hall @ mega-success. com  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  member showcase  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  examine carefully-those with email addresses included will  trade links with you... you are encouraged to contact them.  there are many ways to build a successful business-just look at  these successful sites programs other members are involved  in...  get insane amounts of traffic to your website.  purchase 10,000 guaranteed visitors to your site  and receive 5,000 free. more traffic = more money!  less than 2 cents a visitor. space is limited.  order now! http:// www. freepicklotto. com  trade links-businessopps @ aol. com  stop smoking-free lesson!!  discover the secret to stopping smoking.  to master these powerful techniques, come to  http:// www. breath-of-life. net  for your free lesson.  act now! p. s. tell someone you care about.  trade links-jturco 3 @ hotmail. com  celebration sale!  $ 99. 00 on casinos/sportsbetting sites, lingerie stores,  gift stores, adult sites toy stores.  mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price.  order now!  http:// www. cyberopps. com/?

    "0018.2003-12-18.GP\t1\t await your response\t\" dear partner,  we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight-man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate.  at the moment, we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies, which we intend to transfer to your account, upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you. based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity, loyalty and understanding, we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly. all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative, as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit, that will turn around profit favourably. we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture, and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with. also  bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed$ 13,731, 000,00 usd (thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover, please it should be within the set aside capital. in this regard, the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding; with special emphasis on the following:  1. the tax obligationin your country  2. the initial capital base required in your proposed  investment area, as well as;  3. the legal technicalities in setting up a  business in your country with foreigners as share-holders  4. the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement.  5. your ability to provide a beneficiary/partnership account with a minimal deposit, where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently.  another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on, is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing. since we are the owners of the funds, and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country, we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring  such huge amount of funds, without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations. remember that, on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds. you will be the one to be doing all these, and in the course of transfer, if for any reason whatsoever, you incurred some bills, we shall adequately retire same, upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account. the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen, and to trust your personality and status, especially as it concerns the security of the  funds in your custody.  i await your response,  sincerely,  john adams  (chairman senate committee on banks and currency)  call number: 234-802-306-8507 \""

    "    Answer: A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.\n",
    "    for example in Java instruction N= N- 1 though it looks atomic , it's not . It gets executed into two statements i.e. temp = N -1 and N = temp. Result gets stored in temporary value and then it gets assigned to original memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Now lets say main program initiates two threas T1 and T2\n",
    "    Main ---> T1 and T2\n",

    "### What is MapReduce?\n",
    "    Provides framework for developers to write scalable code.\n",
    "    MapReduce is programming model not a programming language.\n",
    "    Always processes records in key/value format. \n",
    "    Allows data distribution between nodes. Each program consists of Map and Reduce.Its functional programming paradigm i.e. allows developers to focus on business logic.Map does filtering and sorting while Reduce performes summary operations.\n",
    "    This also provides automatic parallelization of data processing.\n",
    "### How it is different from Hadoop?\n",

    "    MapReduce -  Which we can use to process large datasets by divide and conqure \n",

When using multiple reducers Hadoop will by default give you a partial sort (i.e., all records within a partition will be sorted by the key (i.e., key part of the key-value pairs produced by the mappers) .\n",
    "To achieve a total sort one needs to write a custom mapper to to prepend a partition key to each record, partition on that prepended key, and then do a secondary sort  on a composite key that is made up of the prepended key and the original key.  This can be done with one map-reduce job. This will be covered during Live Session of Week 3."

A Reduce task goes through a similar lifecycle.\n",

Since log(xy) = log(x) + log(y), it is better to perform all computations by summing logs of probabilities rather than multiplying probabilities. Please pay attention to probabilites that are zero!
